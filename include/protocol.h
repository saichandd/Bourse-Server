/*
 * The "Bourse" trading platform protocol.
 *
 * This header file specifies the format of communication between the
 * Bourse server and its clients.  We will use the term "packet" to refer
 * to a single message sent at the protocol level.  A full-duplex,
 * stream-based (i.e. TCP) connection is used between a client and the
 * server.  Communication is effected by the client and server sending
 * "packets" to each other over this connection.  Each packet consists
 * of a fixed-length header, with fields in network byte order,
 * followed by an optional payload whose length is specified in the header.
 *
 * The following are the packet types in the protocol:
 *
 * Client-to-server requests:
 *   LOGIN:    Log a trader into the exchange
 *             Payload: trader username
 *   STATUS:   Request balance/inventory and bid/ask/last info
 *   DEPOSIT:  Deposit funds into trader's account
 *             Payload: amount to deposit
 *   WITHDRAW: Withdraw funds from trader's account
 *             Payload: amount to withdraw
 *   ESCROW:   Increase inventory in escrow for a trader
 *             Payload: quantity to place in escrow
 *   RELEASE:  Release inventory in escrow for a trader
 *             Payload: quantity to release from escrow
 *   BUY:      Post a buy order to the exchange
 *             Payload: quantity
 *                      max price
 *   SELL:     Post a sell order to the exchange
 *             Payload: quantity
 *                      min price
 *   CANCEL:   Attempt to cancel a pending order
 *             Payload: order id
 *
 * Server-to-client responses (synchronous):
 *   ACK:      Sent in response to a successful request
 *             Payload (optional):
 *                      account balance
 *                      inventory
 *                      bid/ask/last
 *                      order ID (for BUY/SELL/CANCEL requests)
 *   NACK:     Sent in response to a failed request
 *
 * Server-to-client notifications (asynchronous):
 * Specific to client:
 *   BOUGHT    Sent when client's BUY order is fulfilled or partially fulfilled
 *             Payload: order ID
 *                      quantity
 *                      price
 *   SOLD      Sent when client's SELL order is fullfilled or partially fulfilled
 *             Payload: order ID
 *                      quantity
 *                      price
 *
 * General ("ticker tape"):
 *   POSTED    Notification that a buy or sell order has been posted for some client
 *             Payload: order type (buy/sell)
 *                      order ID
 *                      quantity
 *                      max/min
 *   CANCELED  Notification that a pending order has been canceled for some client
 *             Payload: order ID
 *                      quantity
 *   TRADED    Notification that a trade has occurred
 *             Payload: seller order ID
 *                      buyer order ID
 *                      quantity
 *                      price
